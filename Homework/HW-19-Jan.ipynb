I fully expect that you will have to look up some commands at [this link](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/).  By the end of the course you’ll understand how to do all of this stuff, and why you’d care to.\n",

The answer is simple: knowledge of Linux and the command line will help you to be a more efficient scientist with a broad set of tools at your disposal. In addition, a good deal of data analysis is done on computer servers, and these invariably run on Linux. "
