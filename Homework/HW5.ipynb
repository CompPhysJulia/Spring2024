    "This homework involves a classic situation in statistical physics: the random walk. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1828, the botanist Robert Brown published a paper called \"\"A brief account of microscopical observations made on the particles contained in the pollen of plants\" in which he observed that pollen grains in water underwent seemingly random motion. He did not know the cause of this motion, but he did determine that any substance, when ground up to a sufficiently small size, exhibited this motion, which we now refer to as Brownian Motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't until 1905 that Einstein published a paper (Einstein, A. “Investigations on the theory of the Brownian Motion”, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)) deduced that Brownian motion was evidence of the existance of atoms, and predicted the quantitative aspects of the motion from statistical physics. You can read a short discussion of Brownian motion [here](http://physics.ucsc.edu/~drip/5D/brown/brown.pdf) and at [Wikkipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist,_born_1773)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will simulate Brownian motion and determine a quantitative result about this motion. \n",

    "For purposes of this simulation, imagine an inebriated person placed at the origin $(x,y) = (0,0)$ and only capable of taking steps of lenghth $L$ in either the in $\\pm x$ or $\\pm y$ directions. The intoxicated individual takes $N$ such steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to first computationally implement this $N$ step walk, and then to answer what happens on average, or, as we've talked about in class, to approximate the *ensemble* average by performing a large number of such walks. \n",
