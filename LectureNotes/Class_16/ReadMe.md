# Class 16: 1 Mar 2024

Today's class introduced the material for HW 8. 

We discussed how to analytically compute the magnetic field for a current loop    both on the axis of symmetry and off the axis of symmetry, and explained *why* it makes no difference in how many integration chunks one uses to numerically compute the magnetic field in the special case of **on the axis of symmetry only**. 

The rest of class was time for everyone to work together in pairs on the assignment.
